abstract: '<p><b>Abstract</b>. LLMs change the landscape of software engineering, and the question arises: "How can we combine LLMs with traditional teaching approaches in computer science?". In this work, we propose to teach students in a low-code environment of code generation, developing not only their coding but also decomposition and prompting skills.</p>'

In this study, we compile an extensive corpus of popular Java projects from GitHub, search it for code clones and 
perform an original analysis of possible code borrowing and license violations on the level of code fragments. 
We chose Java as a language because of its popularity in industry, where the plagiarism problem is especially 
relevant because of possible legal action. We analyze and discuss distribution of 94 different discovered and 
manually evaluated licenses in files and projects, differences in the licensing of files, distribution of potential 
code borrowing between licenses, various types of possible license violations, most violated licenses, etc. Studying 
possible license violations in specific blocks of code, we have discovered that 29.6% of them might be involved in 
potential code borrowing and 9.4% of them could potentially violate original licenses.

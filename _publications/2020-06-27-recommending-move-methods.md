In this paper, we propose an approach to recommend Move Method refactoring based on a path-based representation of code 
called code2vec that is able to capture the syntactic structure and semantic information of a code fragment. 
We use this code representation to train a machine learning classifier suggesting to move methods to more 
appropriate classes. We evaluate the approach on two publicly available datasets: a manually compiled dataset of
well-known open-source projects and a synthetic dataset with automatically injected code smell instances. The results 
show that our approach is capable of recommending accurate refactoring opportunities and outperforms JDeodorant and
JMove, which are state of the art tools in this field.

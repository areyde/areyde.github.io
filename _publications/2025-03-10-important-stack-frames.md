abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. In this work, we developed, integrated, and tested a feature that automatically highlights potentially important frames in stack traces. The feature was implemented in the internal bug-processing tool at JetBrains that processes tens of millions of stack traces. We surveyed 18 developers at JetBrains who provided valuable feedback on the idea and the implementation.</p>"

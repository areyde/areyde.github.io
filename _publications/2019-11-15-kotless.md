In this paper, we present Kotless â€” a Kotlin Serverless Framework. Kotless is a cloud-agnostic toolkit that solves 
these problems by interweaving the deployed application into the cloud infrastructure and automatically generating 
the necessary deployment code. This relieves developers from having to spend their time integrating and managing their
applications instead of developing them. Kotless has proven its capabilities and has been used to develop several 
serverless applications already in production. Its source code is available at https://github.com/JetBrains/kotless, 
a tool demo can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMSakPNl3TY.

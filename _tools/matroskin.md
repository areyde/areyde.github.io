abstract: '<p><b>Matroskin</b> is a library for analyzing Jupyter notebooks on a large scale and saving the summary data in a convenient format. The library employs multiprocessing and can process Jupyter notebooks and usual Python files on a local device. You can configure your own local database, change multiprocessing settings, sample sizes, and structural metrics that will be calculated for the files.</p>'

<p>Since 2022, I am lucky to live in <b>Belgrade, Serbia</b>. The country and the city are so beautiful that I stopped almost all <a href="https://areyde.com/travels/">traveling</a> except for work, having found all the necessary diversity of experience right where I live.
It was also here that I discovered a real passion for <b><span style="color: #8a0000">biking</span></b>.
Exploring the wonderful nature and cultural sites of Belgrade, I set out to visit all <b><span style="color: #f1942f">monasteries</span></b> and as many <b><span style="color: #6fac25">towns and villages</span></b> as possible in the city's vicinity available by bike.
This map overlays all of my recent travels, making it glaringly obvious just how much more I have to see!</p>

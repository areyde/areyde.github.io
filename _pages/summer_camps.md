From 2016 to 2018 I was an active member of a university students' team, working at summer camps every summer.
For the first two years, I was a "camp leader", meaning curating and caring for a team of 2025 kids of various ages, 
while in the third year, I was the "musical director" of a summer camp (while ironically not being able to sing or play 
anything except for a ukulele). Since this coincided with my most care-free youth and earned me some little money
to travel by myself for the first time, I remember those summers with love!

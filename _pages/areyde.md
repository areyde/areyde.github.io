When I was little, I really wanted to be a knight, so I decided that I need myself a knight name. I don't really
remember how I selected it, but I ended up with **Areyde** (pronounced _ah-ray-deh_). It might have to do something with
the word "raid", since they are spelled similarly in Russian. 

Later, I also selected a surname — **Areyde Elvgren**, after the painter [Gil Elvgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Elvgren),
having one of the most unusual surnames ever. Importantly for me, Areyde Elvgren also turned out to be an anagram for _Lady Evergreen_,
adding a mystical touch! Moreover, my best friend at the university took the nickname Debora Elvgren, which also 
turned out to be an anagram for _Beloved Ranger_. This made me forever sure that this is my name.

Finally, I had a sigil for Areyde — a white oak on the deep green background. One friend of mine drew Areyde as she imagined
him, and I guess now I have this image to remind me of those times. And the name stuck.

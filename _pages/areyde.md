When I was little, I really wanted to be a knight, so I decided that I need myself a knight name. I don't really
remember how I selected it, but I ended up with **Areyde** (pronounced _ah-ray-deh_). It might have to do something with
the word "raid", since they are spelled similarly in Russian. 

I also had a sigil for Areyde â€” a white oak on the deep green background. One friend of mine drew Areyde as she imagined
him, and I guess now I have this image to remind me of those times. And the name stuck.

When I was little, I really wanted to be a knight, so I decided that I need myself a knight name. I don't really
remember how I selected it, but I ended up with **Areyde** (pronounced _ah-ray-deh_). It might have to do something with
the word "raid", since they are spelled similarly in Russian. I then used it everywhere on the Internet as my nickname.
At some point, I even chose a surname — **Elvgren**, after an American pin-up artist [Gil Elvgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Elvgren).
Very knightly.

I also had a sigil for Areyde — a white oak on the deep green background. One friend of mine drew Areyde as she imagined
him, and I guess now I have this image to remind of those times. But the name stuck with me.

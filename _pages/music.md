In 2017â€“2019, my friends and I were recording a lot of random music for fun. The vast majority of it was completely
unlistenable, but sometimes (when someone could sing) it was barely tolerable! Here, I save three random songs and an "album cover"
that we drew right on the wallpaper of my apartment in the burst of inspiration.

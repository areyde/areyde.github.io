The Chinese language is my biggest hobby. While I am studying it in general too (passed the HSK 3 level and plan to pass HSK 4/5 soon),
I enjoy learning and compiling facts about even more. Specifically, I love everything that has to do with the Chinese
writing system, including learning the characters, studying their history, and practicing calligraphy. 

My biggest project in regard to the Chinese language is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SxoqHYYJOBF0TBHHkFJfwIR6RuQzfbr5c4wXn8cR54M/edit#gid=793622246">the Chinese language database (中文数据库)</a>.
The database consists of two large parts: one is dedicated to the characters in general and can be of interest to anyone,
and the second one is dedicated to my own progress in learning the language and can help those who want to
start learning it.

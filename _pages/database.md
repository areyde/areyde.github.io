The Chinese language is my biggest hobby. While I am studying it in general too (passed the HSK 3 level and plan to pass HSK 4/5 soon),
I enjoy learning and compiling facts about even more. Specifically, I love everything that has to do with the Chinese
writing system, including learning the characters, studying their history, and practicing calligraphy.

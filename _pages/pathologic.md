In 2015, I briefly participated in a translation of a video game into English, namely, 
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/384110/Pathologic_Classic_HD/">"Pathologic Classic HD"</a>. In reality, I 
was just helping and practicing, and so translated very little, however, they still added me to the credits.
It's a surprising honor, given the fact that this is a great game and a cult classic.

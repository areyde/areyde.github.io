In 2019, right before joining JetBrains, I briefly worked at the <a href="https://news.itmo.ru/en/">ITMO University News Portal</a>
for about a month, during the course of which I took five interviews with various researchers:

* <a href="https://news.itmo.ru/en/news/8275/">"Quantum Physicist Oleksandr Kyriienko on the Future of Computing and Making a Career in Science"</a>

In late 2017, I participated in the WorldSkills Russia contest, in the "Laser Technologies" trade. 
I [won the university round](https://news.itmo.ru/en/education/cooperation/news/7065/) and qualified for the all-Russia final in Moscow. In this final, I got a 
[respected second place](https://kazan.newlaser.ru/news/2017/worldskills-final.php), slightly undercut by the fact that there were only two finalists! ðŸ—¿

Nonetheless, this was a great experience that gave me more practical skills than all six years of studies
combined. I made a lot of cool things from wood, plastic, and metal with my own hands, and â€” even more importantly! â€” used the
access to a CO2 laser to engrave my ukulele! ðŸª•

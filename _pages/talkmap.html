<p>Saying that <i>you like to travel</i> sounds almost pointless — who doesn't? However, similarly to
<a href="https://areyde.com/chinese/">the Chinese language</a>, it's not just the thing itself that I love, but also
    analyzing it, gathering statistics about it, and visualizing it. Luckily, it's rather obvious with traveling. I am not an avid traveler, however, I did record all the places I have been to.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><span style="color: #cd3b28">Red</span></b> markers indicate my home region and the nearest towns.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: #f4942e">Orange</span></b> markers indicate places where I have lived for at least a month.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: #6eaa25">Green</span></b> markers indicate places where I have traveled to for the sake of traveling or on vacation.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: #37a7da">Blue</span></b> markers indicate places where I have been to as a part of my work or studies.</li>
    <li><b><span style="color: #a0a0a0">Grey</span></b> markers indicate places where I did not do anything, really, except for transiting, like airports or long stops on the train routes. Given the fact that I did not really explore these places in any meaningful way, you may ask — isn't it cheating? In some way, of course it is, which is why they are colored grey. On the other hand, in addition to <i>cultural</i> mapping, I am also interested in what you could call a <i>geometric</i> mapping — I am interested in all the places on the globe where my legs have stood and my lungs have breathed!</p></li>

<p>Saying that <i>you like to travel</i> sounds almost pointless â€” who doesn't? However, similarly to
<a href="https://areyde.com/database/">the Chinese language</a>, it's not just the thing itself that I love, but also
    analyzing it, gathering statistics about it, and visualizing it. Luckily, it's rather obvious with traveling.</p>

<p>I am not an avid traveler, however, I did record all the places I have been to.

My name is Yaroslav Golubev, I am a research administrator and a data analyst at
[JetBrains Research](https://research.jetbrains.org/), led by [Dr. Timofey Bryksin](https://jzuken.github.io/). 
I also enjoy philosophy, linguistics, history, Chinese language and culture, and writing poetry. Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:yaroslav.golubev[at]jetbrains.com)! ✍️

<h2 style="margin-top: -5px;">Background 🖼️</h2>

Born and raised in Saint Petersburg. ⚓

In 2018, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in <b>Applied Physics</b> 👨‍🔬 from [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/), with a major in laser
technologies, and planned to become a researcher. While there, I worked as a lab assistant, a guide in the educational museum of optics, as well as a
secretary in the International Students office, and participated in the [THE BRICS & Emerging Economies Universities Summit](https://areyde.com/brics/)
as a representative of Russian students. Every summer, I also worked as a camp counselor. 🏕️

In 2020, I obtained a Master's degree with honors in <b>Laser Technologies</b> ⚡ from the same university,
with a major in biological and medical applications. During the first year, I worked as an engineer in the lab and a 
[scientific interviewer](https://areyde.com/interviews/) at the university's news portal, and also led the School of Laser Technologies for highschoolers. While studying there, I was lucky to join JetBrains and fell in love with data science. 📊

Finally, I have an unfinished Bachelor's degree in <b>Philosophy</b> 💭 from [Herzen University](https://en.hspu.org/), with a major in philosophical anthropology. In my studies,
I focused on Chinese philosophy, especially Taoism, and conducted research about the concept of relativity in ancient Taoist texts. 
I also [helped out](https://areyde.com/eastern_studies_and_esotericism/) as an assistant in research centers dedicated to Eastern culture, mysticism, and esotericism, as well as helped organize and conduct several scientific conferences. ☯️

<h2 style="margin-top: -5px;">Research 🔬</h2>

While I used to carry out research of my own, I realized that I enjoy helping other people more, and became a <b>research administrator</b>, with the goal of supporting other researchers, both administratively and academically. 🤝
Nowadays, I mostly assist in different stages of projects, from planning to writing. Throughout the years, this enabled me to touch on [all kinds of subjects](https://areyde.com/publications/), including serverless computing, embeddings of code, Jupyter notebooks, code completion, code quality, computer science education, psychology of programming, and others.
It is a great privilege to learn more about these areas from my colleagues. I also still do [academic work](https://areyde.com/academic_work/) like reviewing papers and organizing workshops, as well as occasionally giving classes. 🎓

The overarching theme of <b>my own studies</b> in software engineering was mining large corpora of existing source code and analyzing them to discover various
patterns, as well as better understand how developers write software. While
I was lucky to participate in a number of practical collaborations, my personal interest always leaned closer
to the analytical and the descriptive side of things. Specific topics of my research are:

* code clones, 🐑
* open-source software licenses, 📝
* code changes (patterns and automatic fixes), ️✨
* refactorings, 🛠️
* code and test smells, 👃
* evolution of software ecosystems, 🌱
* AI assistants. 🦾

Before my work in software engineering, I used to [do research](https://areyde.com/physics_conferences/) in the field of <b>laser physics</b>. 💥
While I did not get far, my studies related to laser-matter interaction, specifically, laser irradiation with ultra-short (femtosecond) pulses. 
With a major in laser technologies in biological and medical applications, my last studies were dedicated to combatting viruses, as well as creating colloidal solutions of nanoparticles with antibacterial properties. 🧫

<h2 style="margin-top: -5px;">Hobbies 🎨</h2>

My main hobby outside the realm of software engineering is [writing poetry](https://areyde.com/poetry/) (only in Russian so far). 📜
I also love [philosophy](https://areyde.com/favourite_philosophers/) and care especially deeply about Eastern philosophy — mainly, Taoism, Buddhism, and Ājīvika, — as well as [mysticism and esotericism](https://areyde.com/eastern_studies_and_esotericism/). 🔮
Another major love of mine is the Chinese language and sharing with people how awesome it is. 
In addition to learning it, I love [analyzing its content, popularity, history, and evolution](https://areyde.com/chinese/). In general, 
I am interested in all major humanitarian fields, especially linguistics and history. 🏛️

Finally, while I am not an avid traveler, I did write down 
[all the places where I have been](https://areyde.com/travels/). There aren't too many of them, but luckily, the number can only go up! 🧳

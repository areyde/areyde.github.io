Hello! My name is Yaroslav Golubev, I am a senior researcher in the
[Machine Learning Methods in Software Engineering](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/ml_methods/) group at
[JetBrains Research](https://research.jetbrains.org/). I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics and a
Master's degree in Laser Technologies from [ITMO University](https://en.itmo.ru/), and am currently getting
a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from [Herzen University](https://en.hspu.org/).

The overarching theme of my studies is mining large volumes of existing source code and analyzing them to better 
understand how developers write software and create tools that can help them do it more efficiently. While
I was lucky to participate in a number of fruitful and practical collaborations, my personal interest leans closer
to the analytical and the descriptive side of things. Specific topics of my works include cross-project code clones,
licensing violations, common patterns of code changes, and test smells.

My main hobby outside the realm of software engineering is studying Chinese language and [sharing with people
how awesome it is](https://areyde.com/database/). I also care deeply about Eastern philosophy — mainly, Taoism and
Buddhism, — and enjoy philosophy in general. Finally, things that I love but would like to know more about include
linguistics, history, and biology.
